# 1.2.0 — reusable APEX pattern catalog

English | [Українська](release-notes.uk.md)

## Changes — 2026-09-24

- Find **58 reusable patterns** through offline `corpus: "patterns"` retrieval and stable `pattern:` IDs. Adapt **84 recipes**: 69 have compiler-checked implementations and 15 retain explicit unresolved reasons.
- Review **150 source pages and 818 meaningful variants** from Universal Theme Reference and Oracle APEX UX Pattern Catalog. Coverage records bind each page decision to its exact source hash; missing or stale reviews, unknown source anchors and orphan patterns fail the build.
- Use the new `$apexrest-pattern-catalog` skill to add patterns from identified APEX applications. Capture source facts read-only, preserve stable source IDs, curate original recipes and verify changed dependencies before packaging.
- Search in English or Ukrainian through the existing MCP reference tools and CLI. Read large coverage records with pagination and recover all links. Installed catalog retrieval works offline without a project or Oracle connection.
- Preserve the existing component catalog with **109 families and 138 ready recipes**, default `corpus: "apexlang"`, Oracle reference IDs, SQLcl/ORDS operations and deployment safeguards. The plugin now provides **18 MCP tools and 13 skills** in the current Codex conversation.

Browse the [Universal Theme component list and examples](https://apex.oracle.com/ut), then follow the [pattern catalog guide](pattern-catalog.md) or [component catalog guide](component-catalog.md).

## Verification and limits

[Current catalog evidence](evidence/pattern-catalog-local.json) records 69 real offline SQLcl compiler passes without warnings, bound to the exact scaffold and recipe inputs. Local checks passed: 187 unit tests, 57 contract tests, 26 installer tests and 25 packaging tests, plus deterministic catalogs, bilingual documentation, plugin synchronization and relocated offline CLI/MCP retrieval. The [previous component evidence](evidence/component-catalog-local.json) preserves its 138 compiler proofs unchanged.

`ready` means a complete declared local dependency set with matching compiler evidence. Prerequisite SQL execution, application import, authenticated browser behavior and native host model execution remain separate and were not run for this catalog work. Payload measurements use UTF-8 bytes, not billed tokens.

## Distribution

`apexrest@1.2.0` is prepared for authorized publication to npm `latest`; registry integrity and clean-install verification are pending. The [previous 1.1.0 publication record](evidence/npm-110-publication.json) remains historical evidence and does not verify 1.2.0.

npm publication is separate from the disabled protected GitHub artifact publisher. It does not claim signed GitHub artifacts, a Git tag, website deployment or full platform/Oracle qualification. Updating the active Codex plugin cache and opening a new conversation to load its tools are separate installation actions.

[Implementation status](implementation-status.md), the [acceptance matrix](acceptance.json), [publisher setup](publishing.md) and [open verification](next-actions.md) track those boundaries.

## Historical releases

These records describe earlier versions, not the current product. Their source digests, outcomes and limitations remain unchanged.

Historical reports include removed functionality. They are retained as provenance, not current APIs or workflow instructions. Existing Oracle evidence does not establish changed imports, SQL restore or new native-platform coverage for 1.2.0.
