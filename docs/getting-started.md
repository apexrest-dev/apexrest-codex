# Getting started

English | [Українська](getting-started.uk.md)

Start with the terminal menu to install tools and the plugin, then test a saved SQLcl connection. The repository includes the built runtime, so these steps need no TypeScript build or `npm ci`. Direct installation through the Codex CLI is also documented below.

The current distribution is beta. Native-host evidence is specific to the tested Codex and platform combination; [stable release gates](next-actions.md) remain open.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement                             | When it is needed                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Codex with native plugin support        | Plugin registration; Codex CLI 0.154.0 was exercised on macOS arm64 |
| Node 24 LTS available on `PATH`         | Starting the bundled TUI, CLI and MCP runtime                       |
| Java 21 and reviewed SQLcl 26.1.2       | Oracle generation, validation, export and import                    |
| Existing supported Oracle APEX target   | Connected workflows require APEX 26.1+                              |
| Named SQLcl connections                 | Authorized access to the configured target, saved locally           |
| Chromium and relevant test dependencies | Browser/API suites; utPLSQL only when a SQL suite requires it       |

An existing clean APEX installation is enough for ordinary deployment. Service tables, utPLSQL and a provisioned sandbox are not blanket prerequisites for an application-only import. Source installation does not include Oracle binaries, browser credentials or a database account.

## Install with the terminal menu

With Git and Node 24 LTS on PATH, open the TUI without a local build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/apexrest-dev/apexrest-codex.git
cd apexrest-codex
node plugins/apexrest-apex/runtime/apexrest.mjs
```

If you already have a checkout, enter it and run only the last command. After making your own source changes, refresh the bundled package with `npm run plugin:sync`.

The home screen shows the APEXREST logo and six actions:

| Action                       | Purpose                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Install tools                | Install managed Node.js, Java, SQLcl, Playwright and Chromium.                  |
| Uninstall tools              | Remove recorded managed tools while preserving external runtimes.               |
| Install plugin               | Register the plugin in Codex with the existing runtime and create the launcher. |
| Uninstall plugin             | Remove the managed plugin registration and files.                               |
| List saved SQLcl connections | Show names directly from SQLcl's connection store.                              |
| Test saved SQLcl connection  | Choose a saved connection and check database access.                            |

The APEXlang dashboard on the home screen lists bundled item and component types in a searchable table. Tab switches between actions and the catalogue; type a name or group to filter. Browsing requires no installed tools or database connection. See the [terminal guide](tui.md#apexlang-dashboard).

Choose **Install tools**, read the [Oracle terms](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/licenses/oracle-free-license.html), and enable **Accept Oracle license terms** if you agree. Leave **Skip browser installation** off for browser tools, or enable it to omit them. Ctrl+R opens **Review**, and Enter installs. Browser system-package permission is a separate advanced option.

Then choose **Install plugin** and press Enter on **Review**. This action uses the existing runtime and does not reinstall tools. To choose another Codex profile, package source or managed directory, press Esc and expand options with Ctrl+O. If you installed tools in a custom directory, choose that same **Managed tools directory** for the plugin.

The TUI has no **Preview only** or **Approve changes** toggles: the final Enter executes the action. License and system-package consent remain separate. Read the result and any unfinished actions, restart Codex and start a new task. Next, configure the [launcher on PATH](#use-the-cli) and [test a connection](#connect-and-configure).

## Install the plugin

In a terminal where Node 24 and the Codex CLI are available:

```sh
node --version
codex --version
codex plugin marketplace add apexrest-dev/apexrest-codex
codex plugin add apexrest-apex@apexrest
codex plugin list --json
```

Native plugin installation was verified with Codex 0.154.0, Node 24.21.0 and macOS arm64; the [native installation report](evidence/native-repository.json) records the exact installation source and verification scope.

This registers the repository's `apexrest` marketplace and its `apexrest-apex` plugin in the selected Codex profile. Start a new Codex task after installation, then ask:

> Use APEXREST to check my setup. Call the plugin's doctor and distinguish native tool availability, compiler readiness and database connectivity. Guide me through any missing local setup without requesting passwords in chat.

Verify the actual `apexrest_doctor` result. A successful registration or list entry alone does not prove that MCP started, SQLcl compiles or the target is reachable. The native bundle performs no downloads during MCP startup and needs no manually added global MCP server.

Managed-workspace plugin availability can be restricted by the workspace administrator. The CLI commands above are local native registration, not an organization-wide deployment. See [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) if the host does not expose the tools.

### All functions in the Codex plugin menu

Send `Use $apexrest-menu` in the Codex message box. The **All functions** skill displays the menu in the conversation; the plugin does not add a permanent APEXREST sidebar or top-menu button.

To find the installed plugin in the desktop app, open **Plugins**, review the **Installed** list and look for **APEXREST for Codex**. Current [official plugin guidance](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/plugins) uses `@` in the message box to select a plugin or bundled skill; search for APEXREST or **All functions**. In Codex CLI, use `/plugins` for plugins and `/skills` or `$` for skills, as described in [official skill guidance](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills). If the picker does not show the entry, send the direct prompt above. After updating a plugin, start a new task; restart Codex if the skill list remains stale. Native discovery of skill labels and prompts does not establish their visible placement in every Codex UI.

The conversational menu routes to every workflow below. Each workflow also has its own readable skill label and starter prompt:

| Menu entry               | Functions                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Install dependencies     | Java, SQLcl, Node.js, Playwright and Chromium; preview and offline options   |
| Setup and connections    | Toolchain diagnostics, local connection references and plugin maintenance    |
| Projects                 | Create, adopt and inspect projects                                           |
| APEX applications        | Generate, edit, export, validate and compare applications; Oracle references |
| Database and PL/SQL      | Read metadata, design schema changes and plan migrations                     |
| Deployment and recovery  | Plan, authorized import, status and restore planning                         |
| Tests and browser checks | Configured suites, browser authentication, reports and in-app verification   |
| Diagnostics and jobs     | Troubleshoot failures, inspect/cancel jobs and read artifacts                |
| Review changes           | Source preservation, deployment risk, security and release evidence          |

The All functions entry includes the complete CLI operation index. Unsupported sandbox provisioning is explicitly marked unavailable. Opening the menu does not execute its actions. Codex supports up to three plugin-level starter prompts; the full menu and per-skill entries provide access to every workflow. Start a new Codex task after updating the plugin to load the new menu metadata.

### Install dependencies from the plugin menu

Choose **Install dependencies** in the APEXREST plugin's skill menu, or invoke `$apexrest-install-dependencies`. The command offers all client dependencies, Oracle tools without the browser, or a preview only. You can also ask:

> Use $apexrest-install-dependencies to install Java, SQLcl and the other APEXREST client dependencies.

It runs the bundled installer for reviewed Node.js, Java, SQLcl, Playwright and Chromium versions. It previews destinations and downloads, preserves native registration, and verifies the installed tools. Oracle license consent is separate from permission to install dependencies; Codex shows the actual terms when consent is needed. Node must already be available to start the plugin.

From a source checkout, the same dependency-only command is available without a build:

```sh
node plugins/apexrest-apex/runtime/apexrest.mjs dependencies install --dry-run --json
node plugins/apexrest-apex/runtime/apexrest.mjs dependencies install --yes --accept-oracle-license --json
```

Run the second command only after accepting the Oracle terms shown by the preview. Use `--skip-browser` for Oracle tools, `--offline` for cached installation, and `--home` or `--cache-dir` for custom storage. Browser OS package installation requires explicit `--install-os-deps`. Dependencies use `~/.apexrest` by default (or `APEXREST_HOME`); a custom `--home` must also be supplied as `APEXREST_HOME` to later runtime processes. This command does not provision APEX, install utPLSQL, or change database connections. Browser setup problems and missing consent remain visible as unresolved actions.

### Managed runtime installation

The managed installer is an alternative when you want reviewed user-local Node, Java, SQLcl and Playwright setup. From a reviewed source checkout with Node 24:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/apexrest-dev/apexrest-codex.git
cd apexrest-codex
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run build
npm run site:build
npm run release:dry-run
```

Open `dist/releases/install-local.txt`, which contains the exact Bash or PowerShell command with the generated archive name and SHA-256. Review that command before running it. `--yes` authorizes technical setup; `--accept-oracle-license` is separate consent to the linked vendor terms. The installer can reuse compatible existing runtimes and writes managed dependencies under `~/.apexrest` by default.

Supported options include `--dry-run`, `--offline`, `--cache-dir`, `--home`, `--codex-home` and `--native-only`. Project-only Codex enablement is blocked on the tested host; a dedicated profile through `--codex-home` is available. No shell profile is edited. Registration uses the same plugin identity, so do not keep competing installations of that identity in different marketplaces or add a duplicate global MCP server.

Setup checks the selected Codex profile before downloading tools. A valid local marketplace containing only the expected APEXREST plugin can be moved into managed installation even without an earlier managed receipt. Preview shows that existing installation and the planned update; `--yes` authorizes applying it. No force flag is required. For a registration-only update using the existing runtime:

```sh
apexrest setup --native-only --dry-run --json
apexrest setup --native-only --yes --json
```

`--native-only` omits tool downloads from both preview and apply. The update retains the previous plugin files and backs up the Codex configuration. A foreign, remote or ambiguous marketplace stays blocked with `MARKETPLACE_OWNERSHIP_CONFLICT`; the diagnostic identifies its root and Codex profile. Review that registration or select another profile through `--codex-home`. If an interrupted update leaves an unknown result, review its saved transition record before retrying. See [registration status](implementation-status.md#existing-local-plugin-registration) for verification scope.

The local packaging command generates unsigned beta artifacts and reports readiness. It does not publish or certify a stable release.

## Connect and configure

Open **List saved SQLcl connections** or **Test saved SQLcl connection**. Both load the SQLcl store without APEXREST references. Type to search, select with arrow keys and press Enter to test; Ctrl+R refreshes the list. The result shows the database, service and schema or the actual failure. Save missing credentials in SQLcl; the TUI has no password field.

Equivalent commands after configuring the launcher:

```sh
apexrest connection list --saved --json
apexrest connection test 'Development connection' --saved --json
```

Replace `Development connection` with the exact saved name. An empty list means the local SQLcl store has no saved connections. Project deployment still requires explicit connection references and target configuration:

Save the needed connections interactively in SQLcl's local store. Use separate read and deploy connections when available. Give Codex the connection reference names and non-secret target identity:

> Configure an APEXREST test environment using the locally saved SQLcl connections `saved-read-connection` and `saved-deploy-connection`. The workspace is `YOUR_WORKSPACE`, parsing schema `YOUR_SCHEMA`, application ID `100`, database unique name `YOUR_DB`, service `YOUR_SERVICE`, and application URL `https://your-host.example/ords/r/workspace/app/`. Verify that the read connection matches this identity.

Replace every placeholder with the actual target. APEXREST records names rather than passwords. No target environment is invented by project initialization. Follow [configuration](configuration.md) for the exact environment schema, private trust policy and test origins.

## Create or adopt a project

For a new app, use a new or existing empty directory and choose the relevant template:

> Use APEXREST to create a blank application in a new `sales-app` project. Configure the identified test target, add a dashboard using real source measures, then complete the plan, authorized import and browser checks.

For an existing app:

> Use APEXREST to initialize an existing-app project in a new `sales-app` directory and adopt the identified test application. Preserve all Oracle IDs, `.apex` metadata, unrelated pages, shared components and authentication. Add the requested dashboard, import it into that same app and verify the result.

To initialize an existing-app project in the current empty folder from the CLI:

```sh
apexrest project init . --template existing-app
```

The project alias uses the actual folder name. Initialization rejects nonempty directories, files and symbolic links to preserve existing data. This command creates local project files; adoption remains a separate operation.

Adoption and export use new local directories and fail if they would overwrite local edits. Preserve the generated Oracle metadata in version control. Subsequent changes should use the existing working source; do not re-adopt the app each time. See [existing applications](existing-app.md).

## Edit, plan, import and verify

The plugin inspects the project and target configuration once, reuses bounded version-aware references and batches related source edits. Planning includes real compiler validation, so a separate identical compilation is usually unnecessary immediately before it.

Review the concrete plan's target and scope. It binds the source, toolchain, current target and history, and expires after 30 minutes. An explicit request to create, update or import an identified development/test app authorizes that necessary scoped import. Codex records the existing authorization for the exact plan and continues without requesting the same permission twice. Unrelated schema writes, authentication changes, other targets and production are outside that scope.

Apply checks fresh identity and drift, makes a verified SQL backup for an existing app, freezes the source and uses durable coordination. Long MCP operations return a job ID; monitor it until completion instead of starting the same operation again. A failed or unknown write outcome requires diagnosis or reconciliation before retrying.

For a page or dashboard, reconcile relevant read-only source queries and inspect the imported behavior in the Codex in-app browser when available. Let asynchronous APEX regions finish loading, then check changed filters, charts, dates and empty states. Run the configured automated suites appropriate to the change. Record manual browser observations separately; an empty suite list does not mean automated tests passed. See [testing](testing.md).

## Use the CLI

Run `apexrest` or `apexrest tui` for the APEXREST logo and six actions: tool/plugin installation and removal, plus saved SQLcl connection listing/testing. Categories and other workflows are absent from the TUI. See [the terminal guide](tui.md) for controls, direct execution and verification scope. CLI `connection list --saved` and `connection test NAME --saved` access the SQLcl store directly; without `--saved`, existing APEXREST reference behavior is preserved. Explicit commands retain their scripting behavior.

Direct installation with `codex plugin add` exposes the plugin to Codex but does not create the managed `apexrest` launcher. A reviewed source checkout can run its checked-in CLI directly with Node 24:

```sh
node plugins/apexrest-apex/runtime/apexrest.mjs doctor --json
node plugins/apexrest-apex/runtime/apexrest.mjs project init ./crm --template customer-crm
```

The TUI's **Install plugin** action and managed setup create `~/.apexrest/bin/apexrest` on macOS/Linux or `apexrest.ps1` in the managed `bin` directory on Windows. Installing tools alone does not create this launcher. For the default home on macOS/Linux, add it to the current shell's PATH:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.apexrest/bin:$PATH"
apexrest
```

For future shells, add the `export PATH` line to the appropriate shell startup file. APEXREST does not edit it automatically. In PowerShell, invoke the full launcher path:

```powershell
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.apexrest\bin\apexrest.ps1"
```

For a custom managed directory, use its `<home>/bin` path. Without managed installation, `node plugins/apexrest-apex/runtime/apexrest.mjs` from the checkout opens the same menu. If installation did not complete, inspect its result before adding a nonexistent launcher to PATH.

The following examples abbreviate the launcher as `apexrest`; replace it with its full path or the checked-in Node command:

```sh
apexrest connection add dev-read --sqlcl-name saved-read-connection
apexrest connection add dev-deploy --sqlcl-name saved-deploy-connection
apexrest project inspect --project ./crm --json
apexrest deploy plan --project ./crm --env dev --out plans/dev.json
apexrest deploy apply --project ./crm --plan plans/dev.json
```

Configure `environments.dev`, review and trust the project, and supply the authorized exact-target policy before the target operations. The CRM template includes schema changes and required SQL/E2E suites, so its import needs their applicable authorization and dependencies. For a diagnostics-only compiler run, use `apexrest apex validate --project ./crm --json`.

Command help is available through `--help`. CLI `apex export` uses `--output`; `deploy plan` uses `--out`. JSON output reports classified results and exit codes. CLI and MCP share the same core checks.

When calling project-scoped MCP tools, pass the absolute application project directory in the `project` argument. The native server starts in its installed plugin directory, so missing or relative project paths are rejected before work starts. CLI examples resolve `--project` from the terminal working directory.

## Remove managed tools and the plugin

Choose **Uninstall tools** or **Uninstall plugin**, then press Enter on **Review**. Tool removal deletes only recorded managed versions; external runtimes, projects, backups, SQLcl connections and download cache are preserved. Node.js needed by the launcher or a recorded plugin installation is retained. Operating-system packages are not removed.

If removing both, uninstall tools first, then the plugin. Removing plugin files also removes the code targeted by the managed launcher. To retain that code after unregistering the plugin, enable **Keep plugin files** in the plugin removal action's advanced options. The checkout's Node command remains a separate entry point.

Equivalent CLI commands to remove both:

```sh
apexrest dependencies uninstall --yes
apexrest plugin uninstall
```

Use the same managed directory and `--home` if you customized it. For direct registration without a managed installation record, use the Codex commands below. Uninstalling does not undo database deployments.

## Remove the repository plugin

For the direct repository installation:

```sh
codex plugin remove apexrest-apex@apexrest
codex plugin marketplace remove apexrest
```

Remove the marketplace only when you no longer need its entries. Start a new Codex task after removal. This unregisters the native plugin; it is not a request to delete application projects, backups, SQLcl credentials or durable deployment history. A managed installation has its own `apexrest plugin uninstall` command with ownership checks.

## Next steps

Read [deployment safety](deployment-safety.md) before operating a target, [security](../SECURITY.md) before sharing artifacts and the [verification status](implementation-status.md) before selecting this beta for a production workflow. The [documentation index](index.md) links the complete guides and evidence.
