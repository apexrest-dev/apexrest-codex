# Deployment without service tables

The user amended the plugin rules on 2026-09-12: missing APEXREST service tables must not block ordinary deployment to a clean supported APEX installation. The original build specification is preserved; this amendment is recorded in AGENTS.md and ADR 007.

## Implemented

- Omitted `deploymentControl` now selects `local` for both plan and apply. No APEXREST table query or setup DDL is executed in this mode.
- Local migration history records checksums and `started` before SQL execution. Successful migrations are not replayed; changed checksums and unresolved history stop a subsequent plan.
- Local ownership serializes apps sharing a DB/service/parsing schema within one managed home. A dead preparing owner may recover; writing ownership after an unknown outcome requires reconciliation.
- Plans bind the coordination backend, scope and local store identity. Source/target drift, authorization, backups, required tests and restore policy are retained.
- `deploymentControl: "database"` remains optional for explicitly configured table-backed coordination. It never silently switches to an empty local history if its selected backend fails.
- Deploy, database and setup skills instruct Codex to proceed without requesting service tables for ordinary deployment. utPLSQL is a dependency of SQL suites, not of an application-only deploy.

Local state belongs to `$APEXREST_HOME/deployment-control/` and must persist between runs. Different machines/homes do not share a lock or migration history: use a durable externally serialized CI runner, or explicitly configured database coordination. If migrating from the optional database backend, preserve/reconcile its history; switching to a new empty local store is not a safe migration strategy.

## Verification scope

Local tests cover plan/apply with no control-table calls, persisted migration history, checksum rejection, interrupted-write retention, schema contention, a separate Node runner, dead-owner behavior and store-change rejection. Oracle writes in these tests are explicitly fixtures, not connected deployment evidence. See [testing](testing.md) and [implementation status](implementation-status.md) for the recorded checks and remaining release gates.

Connected imports, restore, migration failure injection, automated SQL/CRUD suites and independent-machine concurrency require their own integration evidence. Native lifecycle, setup and template-compiler reports retain their original source digests and verification scope. Stable release readiness remains false.
