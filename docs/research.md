# Capability research

English | [Українська](research.uk.md)

This page is a historical research record from 2026-09-12. It is not the current execution architecture; see [Codex integration](codex-integration.md). Old host protocol observations do not describe a runtime dependency of 1.1.0.

Research was retrieved on 2026-09-12 from all S01–S18 URLs in the immutable build specification. `docs/evidence/research-sources.json` records HTTP status, resolved URL and SHA-256 for every response. `toolchains/sources.lock.json` pins schema bytes and the reviewed Oracle skill commit. Retrieval is provenance, not a claim that every documented Oracle component was exercised.

Observed locally: Codex 0.154.0, standalone CLI and app-server protocol; Node 24.21.0 (managed) and system Node 25.9.0; Oracle SQLcl 26.1.2.132.1334; Temurin Java 21.0.12.1+1; Oracle-generated MMD 26.1.0+3102. npm versions and platform-specific downloads/hashes are pinned in the committed locks. SQLcl's current download page also lists a later release; this beta deliberately uses the actually tested 26.1.2 compiler. Never substitute a moving latest URL for a lock entry.

Native observations: `codex plugin marketplace add PATH --json`, `codex plugin add apexrest-apex@apexrest --json`, `plugin list --marketplace apexrest --json`, app-server plugin/list, skills/list, mcpServerStatus/list and mcpServer/tool/call. Enable/disable used the supported config/value/write API in an isolated profile; uninstall was checked with a fresh host thread. No model invocation or user login token copy was used. Compat exposed tools; portable exposed the plugin/skills but no MCP tool inventory on the same host. See native evidence JSON and ADR 001.

Actual Oracle commands: `sql -version`; `/nolog` `help apex`; `apex generate -name NAME -alias ALIAS -dir STAGING`; `apex validate -input SOURCES`. Both templates compile with the original MMD retained. CRM initially revealed a missing report heading and unsupported dynamic-action event placement; sources were corrected and rerun until validation succeeded. DB export/import flags follow the retrieved SQLcl command reference but still need connected integration tests.

Oracle snapshots are UPL-1.0. The September 12 research used `b0afa3bfd7c7e3547458d7fe52649ab1b59706b7`; those observations retain their original scope. The current reference corpus and source lock pin `b94ccf4dec34b27859c2378fa71ba2bad884f2fe`, refreshed on September 22; see the [current corpus and verification](apexlang-optimization.md). Only reviewed grammar/example data is packaged; the upstream skills router's differing permission model is not installed. Exact browser revisions come from Playwright 1.63.0's browsers.json. macOS arm64 client checks do not establish Linux, Windows, WSL2 or sandbox support.
