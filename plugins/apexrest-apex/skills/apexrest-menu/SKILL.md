description: Show the APEXREST plugin menu and route the selected command or capability.

# All functions

Show these choices and load only the selected workflow. Opening the menu is navigation, not permission to install, deploy or run every function.

| Choice | Workflow |
| --- | --- |
| Implement APEX changes in this chat; reviewed team after explicit Settings opt-in | [Work](../apexrest-work/SKILL.md) |
| Inspect, steer or stop existing work; explicit team orchestration | [Team](../apexrest-team/SKILL.md) |
| Open the development panel inside Codex | [Panel](../apexrest-panel/SKILL.md) |
| Install/preview Node.js, Java, SQLcl, Playwright and Chromium | [Dependencies](../apexrest-install-dependencies/SKILL.md) |
| Diagnose tools, configure SQLcl CLI/MCP or connections, inspect installation | [Setup](../apexrest-setup/SKILL.md) |
| Initialize/adopt a project; inspect source and environments | [Projects](../apexrest-project/SKILL.md) |
| Generate/edit/export/validate/compare APEXlang; pinned Oracle references | [APEXlang](../apexrest-apexlang/SKILL.md) |
| Metadata, migrations and PL/SQL | [Database](../apexrest-database/SKILL.md) |
| Plan/apply authorized changes, deployment status and restore plans | [Deployment](../apexrest-deploy/SKILL.md) |
| SQL/API/browser suites, interactive authentication and selected-browser checks | [Tests](../apexrest-test/SKILL.md) |

Prefer purpose-built MCP tools; pass the user's absolute application directory as `project`. For CLI-only actions, resolve `../../runtime/apexrest.mjs` from this skill to an absolute path and invoke with Node; native installation does not add `apexrest` to PATH. Read only the selected command's `--help`. For the complete command inventory, read [CLI catalog](references/cli-catalog.md).

Menu selection supplies no missing target identity, Oracle license acceptance or production approval. Preserve named local connection references, source, backup/drift/coordination and unknown-outcome protections. Never request passwords in chat. Distinguish fixtures, native discovery, Oracle results and browser observations.
