# Supported versions and evidence

English | [Українська](versions.uk.md)

Release {{version}} is packaged as `apexrest@1.2.0` and available through the source repository. Install with `npm install -g apexrest`; [release notes](../../docs/release-notes.md) record distribution status. Native-platform and Oracle integration qualification retains its documented limits.

The supported toolchain targets Node 24 LTS (supported range: Node 24–26), SQLcl 26.1.2.132.1334, Java 21 and APEX 26.1+. ORDS APEXlang operations require a JDK 21+ containing `jdk.compiler`; SQLcl's managed JRE alone is insufficient for the Java bridge. Local generated MMD: 26.1.0+3102. Playwright is pinned at 1.63.0 with its matching browser revisions.

APEXREST works directly in the existing Codex session with 18 MCP tools and 13 skills. The host controls its model, context and permissions. Six long tools wait within one call; metadata batches, summary inspection, cached references and bounded output reduce routine exchanges while preserving diagnostics, recovery and deployment safety. SQLcl and ORDS operations remain available. UTF-8 bytes are payload measurements, not billed tokens. The offline catalogs contain 109 component families with 138 compiler-checked recipes, plus 58 UX patterns with 84 recipes (69 compiler-checked and 15 explicit gaps). Pattern source review covers 150 pages and 818 variant decisions. See [component evidence](../../docs/evidence/component-catalog-local.json) and [pattern evidence](../../docs/evidence/pattern-catalog-local.json); the [historical 1.0.0 record](../../docs/evidence/current-session-100-local.json) retains its original scope.

- macOS arm64: local native host, client setup and compiler checks completed.
- Linux x64: locked client artifacts and installer code; hosted quality gates are configured, while native client and Oracle integration remain unverified.
- Windows x64: locked client artifacts and PowerShell bootstrap; hosted quality gates are configured, while native client and Oracle integration remain unverified.
- WSL2: separate environment; no inherited Windows verification claim.
- Codex compatibility profile: exercised on 0.154.0.
- Product scope: Codex desktop and CLI only; the former portable profile is discontinued and is not built.
- Sandbox: unsupported until a complete licensed Oracle/APEX/ORDS tuple is provisioned and verified.

Existing [ORDS evidence](../../docs/evidence/ords-connected.json) confirms one unchanged application round trip, 21 byte-identical files, a checksum-verified SQL backup and a matching installed-plugin MCP export. SQL restore, changed imports, additional component/static-file/MMD variants, interrupted-response recovery and Windows remain unverified; application browser verification was deferred. Evidence retains its recorded build versions and source digests and does not become a new connected check when this version changes.

Compatibility describes observed behavior, not full APEX component coverage. Exact vendor hashes are in the packaged toolchain lock. Future SQLcl library versions require a separate ORDS bridge compatibility check.
