# Contributing

APEXREST is developed in [apexrest-dev/apexrest-codex](https://github.com/apexrest-dev/apexrest-codex). Public code, CLI help, documentation, examples and diagrams use English. Keep changes focused and make claims match the evidence.

## Set up a checkout

Use Node 24 LTS and the committed lockfile:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/apexrest-dev/apexrest-codex.git
cd apexrest-codex
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run build
```

After source, dependency, skill or resource changes, run `npm run plugin:sync`. It builds and refreshes the checked-in self-contained plugin bundle used by repository installations. Commit the resulting bundle with its source changes.

The normal build does not deploy an app or install Oracle binaries. Native-host setup, vendor downloads, connection onboarding and remote integration have their own prerequisites. See [getting started](docs/getting-started.md).

## Validate a change

```sh
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:unit
npm run test:contracts
npm run test:installers
npm run site:build
npm run test:packaging
```

Run the checks relevant to the changed behavior, including build before packaging tests. Run `npm run plugin:check` after a fresh build to verify that the checked-in plugin matches its generated runtime/resources. `npm run test:repository-plugin` exercises the repository bundle in a fresh isolated Codex profile without connecting to or writing an Oracle target. Native registration changes also need the real isolated Codex lifecycle check; Oracle adapter or application changes need appropriate real compiler/target evidence when a target is authorized and available. If a required environment is absent, record the blocker rather than substituting a mock result. See [testing](docs/testing.md).

## Engineering expectations

- Keep TypeScript strict, use ESM, and synchronize public CLI/MCP schemas with behavior.
- Preserve Oracle-generated `.apex` metadata, IDs, unrelated components and working-tree edits.
- Bind plans to source and target; preserve backup, drift, authorization, coordination and unknown-outcome checks.
- Keep secrets, browser state, local runtimes, raw business data and private backups out of source control.
- Update documentation and the relevant acceptance/evidence records when behavior or verification changes.
- Review dependency upgrades with pinned URLs/hashes, licensing, an architecture decision and actual compatibility evidence.

Preserve `APEXREST_CODEX_PLUGIN_BUILD_SPEC.md` as historical input. Record authorized requirement amendments in the project rules and architecture decisions; do not rewrite the specification to make acceptance easier.

## Open a pull request

Describe the concrete problem and resulting behavior. Include the validation actually run, its environment and any remaining limitation. Explain safety or compatibility tradeoffs when they matter. Reproduce a bug before widening a fix, and avoid unrelated formatting or dependency churn.

Use a `codex/` branch for Codex-created work unless the maintainer requests a different name. Review the staged diff for credentials and private artifacts before committing. A contribution does not authorize deployments, paid resources, release tags or publication.

## Release work

Before packaging a release, run `npm run plugin:sync`, then `npm run plugin:check`, and verify the native repository installation with `npm run test:repository-plugin`. `npm run release:dry-run` creates unsigned local beta artifacts and a readiness report. Stable readiness requires current evidence bound to the exact immutable source. Publishing requires the separate protected workflow and maintainer authorization; it is not part of a normal build or pull request. See [publisher setup](docs/publishing.md).
